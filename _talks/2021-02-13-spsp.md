This talk was part of the "Novel Insights on Morality: Political Polarization, Forecasting Morality, and Moral Machines" Session at SPSP's Annual Convention. 

<i>Abstract</i> Two studies in the United States and Argentina compared agreement reached in dyads (Study 1) and groups (Study 2) having face-to-face discussions about moral issues (Interaction Condition) to expectancy of agreement in participants imagining conversations about these issues (Imagine Condition). Agreement reached in face-to-face discussions exceeded expectancy of agreement in imagined discussions.
