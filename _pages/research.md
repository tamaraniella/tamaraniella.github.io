## Polarizing conversations: Live versus imagined, and their effect on our willingness to communicate
### Tamara Niella, Joaquin Navajas, Sara D. Hodges

To deepen our understanding of communication on polarizing topics, one can consider people’s preconceptions about such interactions: 
How do they compare with what happens in a face-to-face conversation? Does it affect our willingness to engage in such interactions? 
Study 1 was run in two countries: United States and Argentina. In the Interaction Condition (IC), groups and dyads had conversations about a heated moral issue. 
In the Imagine Condition (MC), people’s expectancy of agreement when imagining these conversations was measured. 
Results showed that the proportion of agreement reached in the IC was higher than the expected agreement in the MC. 
Study 2 (ongoing) seeks to replicate this result in dyads with opposite opinions and test the hypothesis that these live conversations, compared to imagining them, 
will have a positive effect on participants’ willingness to interact with others with an opposite opinion in the future. 
We also include measures of intellectual humility, affective polarization, and conversation receptiveness. 
Results supporting our hypothesis would suggest that live interaction could positively impact people’s willingness to exchange 
perspectives on heated topics helping to reduce polarization.
