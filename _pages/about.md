I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Social Psychology at University of Oregon, working in [Sara D. Hodges'](https://psychology.uoregon.edu/profile/sdhodges) Social Cognition Lab. My main interests lay in interdisciplinary research to enhance communication on some of the world's pressing issues: How to make science recommnedations more accesible to the broader community, or how people's morality around climate change issues play a role on the impact of environmental recommendations. I started developing projects in these areas as a Research Fellow at the Center for Advanced Siences LMU (Munich, Germany) with [Prof. Ophelia Deroy](https://www.opheliaderoy.com/). Moreover, I have experience studying polarized conversations - My doctoral thesis focuses on how people with opposite views communicate about moral or political issues: How do our expectations about such interactions compare to actual face-to-face conversations? 

Since 2020, I am Academic Coordinator at the [Oxford Consortium for Human Rights](https://www.oxfordconsortium.org/) : [Hugo Slim](https://www.elac.ox.ac.uk/people/hugo-slim/) and I took the lead towards maintaining OCHR's mission alive amid the COVID-19 Pandemic. We developed a series of webinars focused on key humanitarian issues within the COVID-19 context and a virtual workshop on Racial Justice, Minority Rights & Religious Freedom. Now, we run multiple workshops per year at Oxford and the US on different topics such as: Climate Crisis, New Technologies, Peace & War. 

While obtaining my B.Sc. in Economics (Universidad Torcuato Di Tella), I was a research intern at [Mariano Sigman's](http://www.marianosigman.org/en/) Lab, where I took the lead on two projects based on crowd experiments: One on the [Zero-sum game fallacy](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147125) and another on the [Wisdom of the crowds](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0273-4). These crowd experiments were the first of its kind, involving a 10,000 people audience, as part of the TEDxperiments initiative at TEDXRiodelaPlata (Buenos Aires, Argentina). 

I am also a member of [Expedicion Ciencia](https://expedicionciencia.org.ar/), an Argentinian non-profit whose initiative is to introduce high-school students and educators to a deeper understanding of scientific thinking and experimental design through science camps and workshops. I have been an instructor and assistant coordinator in various projects and more recently I have been working with their Financial Aid team on optimizing the process of fellowship assignments for students.
