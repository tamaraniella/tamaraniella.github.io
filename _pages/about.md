I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Social Psychology at University of Oregon, working in [Sara D. Hodges'](https://psychology.uoregon.edu/profile/sdhodges) Social Cognition Lab. My main interests lay in interdisciplinary research to enhance communication on some of the world's pressing issues such us how to make science recommnedations more efficient and accesible to the broader community or how does people's morality around climate change issues play a role on how environmental recommendations impact our behaviors. I started developing projects in this line of research as a Research Fellow at the Center for Advanced Siences LMU (Munich, Germany) with Prof. Ophelia Deroy. Moreover, I have experience studying inter-perosnal communication to improve polarized conversations and negotiations: my doctoral thesis focuses on how two people with opposite views communicate about moral or political issues: How do our expectations about such interactions compare to actual face-to-face conversations? What effect does a face-to-face interaction have in our willingness to talk to others? 

Since 2020, I am Academic Coordinator at the [Oxford Consortium for Human Rights](https://www.oxfordconsortium.org/) : [Hugo Slim](https://www.elac.ox.ac.uk/people/hugo-slim/) and I took the lead towards maintaining OCHR's mission alive amid the COVID-19 Pandemic. We developed a series of webinars focused on key humanitarian issues within the COVID-19 context and a virtual workshop on Racial Justice, Minority Rights & Religious Freedom. Now, we run multiple workshops per year at Oxford and the US on different topics such as: Climate Crisis, New Technologies, Peace & War. 

While obtaining my B.Sc. in Economics (Universidad Torcuato Di Tella), I was a research intern at [Mariano Sigman's](http://www.marianosigman.org/en/) Lab, where I took the lead on two projects based on crowd experiments: One on the [Zero-sum game fallacy](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147125) and another on the [Wisdom of the crowds](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0273-4). These crowd experiments were the first of its kind, involving a 10,000 people audience, as part of the TEDxperiments initiative at TEDXRiodelaPlata (Buenos Aires, Argentina). 

I am also a member of [Expedicion Ciencia](https://expedicionciencia.org.ar/), an Argentinian non-profit whose initiative is to introduce high-school students and educators to a deeper understanding of scientific thinking and experimental design through science camps and workshops. I have been an instructor and assistant coordinator in various projects and more recently I have been working with their Financial Aid team on optimizing the process of fellowship assignments for students.
